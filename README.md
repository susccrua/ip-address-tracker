## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Fetching from API's is actually super simple with the fetch API! I want to be able to implement my own API next and leverage Express.js.

### Useful resources

- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-fetch-data-from-an-api-in-reactjs/) - This helped me understand the basics of making a fetch call in React.
